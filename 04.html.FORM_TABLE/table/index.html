          Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any
          set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among
          programmers collaboratively developing source code during software
          development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for
          distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches
          running on different systems).
